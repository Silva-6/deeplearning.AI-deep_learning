# Building your Deep Neural Network: Step by Step

Welcome to your week 4 assignment (part 1 of 2)! Previously you trained a 2-layer Neural Network with a single hidden layer. This week, you will build a deep neural network with as many layers as you want!

- In this notebook, you'll implement all the functions required to build a deep neural network.
- For the next assignment, you'll use these functions to build a deep neural network for image classification.

**By the end of this assignment, you'll be able to:**

- Use non-linear units like ReLU to improve your model
- Build a deeper neural network (with more than 1 hidden layer)
- Implement an easy-to-use neural network class
