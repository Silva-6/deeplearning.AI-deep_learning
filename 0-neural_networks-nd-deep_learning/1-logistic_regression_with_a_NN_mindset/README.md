# Logistic Regression with a Neural Network mindset

Welcome! You will build a logistic regression classifier to recognize  cats. You will step through how to do this with a
Neural Network mindset, and will also hone your intuitions about deep learning.

**Instructions:**
- Do not use loops (for/while) in your code, unless the instructions explicitly ask you to do so.
- Use `np.dot(X,Y)` to calculate dot products.

**You will learn to:**
- Build the general architecture of a learning algorithm, including:
    - Initializing parameters
    - Calculating the cost function and its gradient
    - Using an optimization algorithm (gradient descent) 
- Gather all three functions above into a main model function, in the right order.

## 1 - Packages ##

First, let's run the cell below to import all the packages that you will need during this assignment. 
- [numpy](https://numpy.org/doc/1.20/) is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python.
- [h5py](http://www.h5py.org) is a common package to interact with a dataset that is stored on an H5 file.
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org) is a famous library to plot graphs in Python.
- [PIL](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) and [scipy](https://www.scipy.org/) are used here to test your model with your own picture at the end.

```python
import numpy as np
import copy
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import h5py
import scipy
from PIL import Image
from scipy import ndimage
from lr_utils import load_dataset
from public_tests import *

%matplotlib inline
%load_ext autoreload
%autoreload 2
```

## 2 - Overview of the Problem set ##

**Problem Statement**: You are given a dataset ("data.h5") containing:
    - a training set of m_train images labeled as cat (y=1) or non-cat (y=0)
    - a test set of m_test images labeled as cat or non-cat
    - each image is of shape (num_px, num_px, 3) where 3 is for the 3 channels (RGB). Thus, each image is square (height = num_px) and (width = num_px).

You will build a simple image-recognition algorithm that can correctly classify pictures as cat or non-cat.

Let's get more familiar with the dataset. Load the data by running the following code.
```
# Loading the data (cat/non-cat)

train_set_x_orig, train_set_y, test_set_x_orig, test_set_y, classes = load_dataset()
```
We added "_orig" at the end of image datasets (train and test) because we are going to preprocess them. After preprocessing, we will end up with train_set_x and test_set_x (the labels train_set_y and test_set_y don't need any preprocessing).

Each line of your train_set_x_orig and test_set_x_orig is an array representing an image. You can visualize an example by running the following code. Feel free also to change the `index` value and re-run to see other images.
```python
# Example of a picture
index = 25
plt.imshow(train_set_x_orig[index])
print ("y = " + str(train_set_y[:, index]) + ", it's a '" + classes[np.squeeze(train_set_y[:, index])].decode("utf-8") +  "' picture.")
```
Many software bugs in deep learning come from having matrix/vector dimensions that don't fit. If you can keep your matrix/vector dimensions straight you will go a long way toward eliminating many bugs.
