# GRADED FUNCTION: propagate

def propagate(w, b, X, Y):
    """
    Implement the cost function and its gradient for the propagation explained above

    Arguments:
    w -- weights, a numpy array of size (num_px * num_px * 3, 1)
    b -- bias, a scalar
    X -- data of size (num_px * num_px * 3, number of examples)
    Y -- true "label" vector (containing 0 if non-cat, 1 if cat) of size (1, number of examples)

    Return:
    grads -- dictionary containing the gradients of the weights and bias
            (dw -- gradient of the loss with respect to w, thus same shape as w)
            (db -- gradient of the loss with respect to b, thus same shape as b)
    cost -- negative log-likelihood cost for logistic regression

    Tips:
    - Write your code step by step for the propagation. np.log(), np.dot()
