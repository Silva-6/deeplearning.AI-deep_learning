# Neural Network and Deep Learning 

* Set up a machine learning problem with a neural network mindset and use vectorization to speed up your models.

+ Build a neural network with one hidden layer, using forward propagation and backpropagation.

* Analyze the key computations underlying deep learning, then use them to build and train deep neural networks for 
computer vision tasks.
