# Convolutional Neural Networks: Step by Step

Welcome to Course 4's first assignment! In this assignment, you will implement convolutional (CONV) and pooling (POOL) 
layers in numpy, including both forward propagation and (optionally) backward propagation. 

By the end of this notebook, you'll be able to: 

* Explain the convolution operation
* Apply two different types of pooling operation
* Identify the components used in a convolutional neural network (padding, stride, filter, ...) and their purpose
* Build a convolutional neural network
